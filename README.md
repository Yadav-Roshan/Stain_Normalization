  Conducting a quantitative analysis of the results of histology slide preparation errors is challenging. The slides processed or stored under very different conditions are brought into a common normalised space in this paper using two mechanisms. This helps to overcome many known inconsistencies in the staining process. This enables a more accurate quantitative analysis of breast cancer. Over the past decade, computerised acquisition technology has led to increased digital slides in pathology. Digital slides do not always have the exact representation due to differences in colourization, exposition, contrast, brightness, and other distortions. Because hardware and software tools and devices differ between biomedical analysis centres. Many computer vision algorithms are sensitive to these differences. Colour stain normalisation can be a valuable technique to mitigate this misunderstanding in specific tasks such as image retrieval. This paper investigated the effects of colour stain normalisation in patches based on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) image retrieval. We determine how and how much it affects the accuracy of this task using a standard dataset.
